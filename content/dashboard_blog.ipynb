    "After setting up our [dagster pipeline](https://dev.to/sephib/implementing-a-graph-network-pipeline-with-dagster-3i3a), we needed to implement some sort monitoring solution to review the outcome of our workflow. Working in a small DS team we had to push forward and couldn't wait for the _heavy guns_ of the enterprise IT to take over. So until we have their support, here is a simple dashboard that we have put together to monitor our `Assets`.\n",

The framework has integrated logging and the ability to [produce persistent assets](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/asset-materializations#materializing-an-asset) that are stored in a database (in our case _postgresql_) for future references.   \n",
    "For our project we are interested in monitoring the number of nodes and edges that we generate in our data pipline workflow. During our _pipeline run_ we log (or in the Dagster's jargon `Materialize` - see [AssetMaterialization in the documentation](https://docs.dagster.io/examples/materializations#main)) various stats on the datasets that we whish to  manipulate. We would like to view the changes of these stats over time in order to verify the \"health\" of our system/pipeline.\n"

    "Using the Panel / hvplot libraries was quite straightforward. The documentation and reference galleries were very useful, although getting the linkage between some widget actions may require a bit of JS. Working with the examples, as in the last section in the [getting started documentation](https://panel.holoviz.org/getting_started/index.html), in addition to the more advance examples, show the potential for an extended elaborate dashboard if required.
