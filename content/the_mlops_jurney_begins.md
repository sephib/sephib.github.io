# Introduction
Joing [artlist](artlist.io) is a wonderfull opertunity for me. Artlist is a fast growing company with many processes that are beeing developed. The AI team is in the R&D devision while we serve a wide range of teams from the marketing to the content curators. In addition there are many data consumers that are our (potential) clients, thus we need to put inplace a ML foundations, that will allow us to iterate in a robust manner when we iterate over the various AI models.

# Challenges
Working in a small team requires to be self sufficient. we need to manage our infenstructure, easily trace our logs and increase collborations among team mates. This may sound simple and common, but holds many challenges. Here are the elements that we required for our team work:

1. Manage configurations and setting  
2. Unity in logging  
3. CI/CD for development process
4. Standerdize development project structure
5. Standerdize Kubeflow  (Components, usibility)


# Road Map
1. Development
