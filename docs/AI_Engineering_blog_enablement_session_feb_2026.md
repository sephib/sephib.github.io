AI Engineering blog enablement session
We're hosting this blog enablement session to support the AI Engineering goal to create content that will help establish Red Hat as an AI leader within the tech industry and beyond.
Of course, writing a blog post is just one of the ways for you to contribute content in support of this goal. You can also create:
An internally-focused article for the Source
A feature demo or tutorial video
An AI quickstart
Learning path
We'll only be talking about writing for our marketing blogs here, however, giving you tips on what to write, how to write it, and how to submit your blog posts for the Red Hat Blog and the Red Hat Developer Blog.
Hello AI engineering team!

What is a blog post?
Red Hat editorial handbook | Red Hat blog
Blog posts demonstrate:
Your personal experience
Your expertise
Your trustworthiness
And include a clear call to action to encourage readers to continue their journey with Red Hat.
The blog is a conversation tool. Blog authors are humans. Readers are also humans.

What’s the difference between the Red Hat corporate blog and Red Hat Developer blog?

The Red Hat corporate blog acts as a conversation tool for solving business problems through technology. The audience includes IT decision makers, architects, developers, and procurement.
The blog provides opinionated thought leadership on key topics that align to our business and helps the audience understand the value of a solution.
When readers ask about the "why" or the business case behind a technology, the Red Hat Blog provides the strategic answer.

Red Hat Developer speaks directly to the people who put their hands on our products. This includes many job roles: platform engineers, AI engineers, SREs, data scientists, ITOps, and more.
Content focuses on deep technical learning, jobs to be done, and solving specific problems—the "how."
By helping practitioners succeed, even pre-platform adoption, we provide the evidence they need to become champions for Red Hat within their own companies.

Both blogs connect readers to product trials, downloads, and more to keep the conversation going.

Engaging multiple audiences through targeted content on Red Hat blog and Red Hat Developer blog
Thought leadership content
for decision makers and influencers
Hands-on content for practitioners
Colleen
The two blogs work together to expand the reach of your knowledge. We use the Red Hat corporate blog to answer why a technology matters for decision makers and the Developer blog to show how to use it for practitioners.
Strategic to technical: When a leader reads about the business value of hosted control planes on the Red Hat blog, they find a link to the technical tutorial they can send to their team.
Technical to strategic: When a developer solves a problem using our code, they find the thought leadership piece that helps them justify the technology to their manager.

Some writing tips
AI Engineering blog enablement session
Red Hat editorial handbook | Red Hat blog
Use AI, but readers value authenticity
Use AI tools for brainstorming, outlines, and first drafts
But the final version should sound like you, so rewrite the parts that are dense or awkward
Be focused/specific
Demo one feature
Solve one problem
Cover one part of a topic
Keep it short, but not too short
600-800 words is often enough
1000-1200 is great
> 1200 is a lot

Consider working in teams
Co-write one longer piece
Write 2 or more complementary articles
An overview/intro post for Red Hat blog
A technical tutorial for Red Hat Developer
A technical deep dive
Create a demo video for YouTube and write companion post for the blog
23
Deb

* If you need more than 1200 words, that's fine, just consider writing it as a multipart article.
