&lt;p&gt;Recently we had a closer to an R&amp;amp;D project with a prominent university. Although the results of the project were insightful and possibly applicable to our organization, the work processes that the academic R&amp;amp;D team used seemed lacking.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we had a closer to an R&amp;amp;D project with a prominent university. Although the results of the project were insightful and possibly applicable to our organization, the work processes that the academic R&amp;amp;D team used seemed lacking.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I whish to highlight some simple steps that can assist in running Data Science (DS) projects (from the initiation until the deployment) by DS teams, especially those working without the support of specialized tools.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to go into the Project Management aspects but rather some tools and tips for any DS project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*wfMxroB_sHsx06lrreeKew.png" alt="drawing" height="30" href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html" /&gt;  for project structure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this team included MSc. and PhD. students that are running multiple collaborative projects, they did not have a convention for a project structure. While reviewing the deliveries we needed to contact several team members in order to find a specific file. Working with a known template allows all team members to easily save files in designated folders and easily locate files form any project.&lt;br&gt;
The template that is used is not really the issue - we use this &lt;a href="(https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)"&gt;Data Science&lt;/a&gt; template, which sometimes is an overkill for  simple projects, but normally most of the structure is used.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6eaaae8defc78f268eaf0824350a66a1dfcb6aa77210d3dca069d1d1cefebc53/68747470733a2f2f6769742d73636d2e636f6d2f696d616765732f6c6f676f732f646f776e6c6f6164732f4769742d4c6f676f2d32436f6c6f722e706e67" alt="drawing" height="40" href="https://git-scm.com/"/&gt;  (!@$#%)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes - still in the year 2020 - teams run projects without a version control system! The entire project was offline - so the team thought that they did not need one. How difficult is it to &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-run-your-own-git-server/"&gt;set up a local git server&lt;/a&gt;? Although we did not have a failing disc, we did loose a specific file that somehow went missing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Running&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD (low-tec  solution) &lt;br&gt;
   This one is a bit more tricky.  CI/CD is a must these days for any company who is shipping any product, but what about for a &lt;code&gt;Data Science&lt;/code&gt; team? Recently our team decided on a simple CI/CD for our Jupyter Notebooks - which include a &lt;code&gt;kernel restart run all cells&lt;/code&gt;. This solution allows for picking up any notebook and  knowing that what ever is inside the notebook can run without any errors. We supplement this solution with the following procedures:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing functions into a separate  &lt;code&gt;.py&lt;/code&gt; file, leaving the notebook clean and more readable. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separating each notebook as a single step in the analysis pipeline. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complement a set of notebooks with a &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; file describing the general process and specifically the data input/output files.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the project is mature you can upgrade the pipeline into a designated framework such as &lt;a href="https://dagster.io/"&gt;dagster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring experiments&lt;br&gt;
   As scientists - experimentation and failures are part of our daily life. Working in a systematic manner allows for confident in the results and for reproducible science.  Stating that &lt;em&gt;"we checked the various parameters and these values were the optimum"&lt;/em&gt; is not the best practice if these cannot be easily reviewed and reproduced.&lt;br&gt;
   During the past years there are many platform/frameworks that have been developed for managing solution for ML projects. We have settled on &lt;a href="https://mlflow.org"&gt;MLFlow&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for ease of installation and use even in an offline environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many constrains when running a project, however some minimal infrastructure can get you a long way. Working without any guidelines will normally lead to chaos and inefficiency, while lowering the quality level of the science and project.&lt;br&gt;
These days the &lt;code&gt;MLOps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DataOps&lt;/code&gt; tools and guidelines are constantly being developed, so I'm sure we will see ease of use and improvements in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Warming up - My First Blog Post</title><link href="https://sephib.github.io/warming-up-my-first-blog-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-08T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2020-07-08T00:00:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Sephi Berry</name></author><id>tag:sephib.github.io,2020-07-08:/warming-up-my-first-blog-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Getting started with my online blogging&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first post on my new blog.&lt;br&gt;
I hope to be able to share my thoughts and knowledge in the various tech stacks that I'm involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going run on Pelican (a python static web site generator). There are numerous resources on the web - which may conflict with each other. Here is how I boiled it down (while hosting the site on github).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up your environment (with the required installations)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the setup (kickstart setup process)[https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/install.html#kickstart-your-site], follow the documentation on (Pelican tips)[https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html#user-pages] section to publish the blog as a &lt;code&gt;user page&lt;/code&gt;. Create a &lt;code&gt;dev branch&lt;/code&gt; to commit all the files while the blog itself will be published on the &lt;code&gt;main branch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt; as necessary (this will also depends on the &lt;a href="http://www.pelicanthemes.com/"&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins"&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that you will be running with).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publish workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &amp;amp; save changes to file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To view on local computer run &lt;code&gt;make html&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;make serve&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit changes when necessary (on the &lt;code&gt;dev branch&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally when ready you can run &lt;code&gt;make publish&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt; to push the changes to the &lt;code&gt;github.io&lt;/code&gt; site&lt;/li&gt;
